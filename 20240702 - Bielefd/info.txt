Title: Cohen-Macaulay type of endomorphism rings of abelian varieties over finite fields

Abstract: Let A be an abelian variety over a finite field Fq with commutative Fq-endomorphism ring S, which is an order in an Ã©tale algebra over Q. We will study the (Cohen-Macaulay) type of S. When the type is 1 or 2, we will see: that we can easily compute the isomorphism classes of the abelian varieties isogenous to A with the same endomorphism ring S; that the group of Fq-rational points of A is uniquely determined by S; a necessary condition for A to not be isomorphic to its dual variety.
