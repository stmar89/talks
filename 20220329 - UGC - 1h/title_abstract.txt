Title: Polarizations of abelian varieties over finite fields via canonical liftings

Abstract:
We describe all polarizations for all abelian varieties over a finite field in a fixed isogeny class corresponding to a squarefree Weil polynomial, when one variety in the isogeny class admits a canonical liftings to characteristic zero, i.e., a lifting for which the reduction morphism induces an isomorphism of endomorphism rings.
This is joint work with Jonas Bergstr√∂m and Valentijn Karemaker.
