Title: Cohen-Macaulay type of endomorphism rings of abelian varieties over finite fields.

Abstract: Given an order in a number field, or, more generally, in an étale algebra over Q, we will study its (Cohen-Macaulay) type.

We give two applications about abelian varieties over finite fields, with commutative endomorphism algebra, which are ordinary or over a prime field.
The first is a sufficient condition, which involves the type of End(A), for A not being isomorphic to its dual. In particular, such an A cannot be principally polarised or a Jacobian.
As a second application, we show that the group of points of A is uniquely determined by End(A) if the type of End(A) is < 3.

#Comments about the talk:
* It is too long. I could not state and prove both Application Theorems.
* If one has to give more background about AVs/Fq it is impossible to fit in 1h.
* One possibility, that could make the talk go faster, is the following:

- Say that End c End^0 is an order in an étale algebra over Q
- Del/CS Theorem: fractional ideals.
	This will be strong motivation to study fractional ideal.
	Get an interpretation of (I:I) as endomorphism ring.
	If (I:I) is Gorenstein then we understand the fractional ideals.
	Want to go beyond Gorenstein.
- Define trace dual, and type.
- Prop: If type(I:I)=2 then ...
- Applications: 1 an 2.
