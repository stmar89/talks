The seminar has been held on Thursdays and the talks are usually 50 min (+questions).
The audience is usually number theorists in KIAS (mostly postdoc) + few others from outside KIAS.

Title: Polarizations of abelian varieties over finite fields via canonical liftings
Abstract: We describe all polarizations for all abelian varieties over a finite field in a fixed isogeny class corresponding to a squarefree Weil polynomial, when one variety in the isogeny class admits a canonical liftings to characteristic zero, i.e., a lifting for which the reduction morphism induces an isomorphism of endomorphism rings.
