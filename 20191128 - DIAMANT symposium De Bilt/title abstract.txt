"Isomorphism classes of abelian varieties over finite fields"

We explain how to compute the isomorphism classes of abelian varieties in ordinary square-free isogeny classes in terms of (non necessarily invertible) fractional ideals of orders in Ã©tale algebras over Q.
We present a concrete algorithm to perform this tasks and, for the ordinary case, to compute the polarizations and also the automorphisms of the polarized abelian variety.
