Hi Stefano, great!  we usually tell people 50 minutes so that there is time for questions.  
We like to video the talks - please let me know if you want to talk about that.

Here is advice we've given people before:

Planning the talk: Please include an open conjecture or problem and write or latex notes ahead of time.  Please keep the talks accessible and intriguing.  We are trying to reach a very broad audience including early stage graduate students and experts in the field.  Some suggestions:
Explain the main ideas behind the problem, why it's important, why it's still unsolved.
Explain some of the past work on the problem.
Provide an example that illustrates some of the key points
Explain your contribution to the topic. 
Avoid technicalities (for example by referring to the literature).

Happy to talk more about it, cheers, Rachel
