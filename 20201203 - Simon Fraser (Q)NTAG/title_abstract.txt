Hi Türkü,

here are the details of the talk:

Title: Products and Polarizations of Super-Isolated Abelian Varieties

Abstract: Super-isolated abelian varieties are abelian varieties over finite fields whose isogeny class contains a single isomorphism class. In this talk we will review their properties, consider their products and, in the ordinary case, we will describe their (principal) polarizations.


Thank you!

Best,

Stefano
