Dear Stefano,

I'm glad that you're able to speak on May 16!
Please add your talk details at
   https://researchseminars.org/edit/talk/MITNT/74/01fde43186d9e157
when you have a chance.

By the way, I think that the seminar room we usually use (2-449)
is booked for a thesis defense on May 16, but we'll find another one soon.

The talk actually starts at 4:35pm, and you should finish sometime 
around 5:30pm, but we are not too strict.

Best,
Bjorn
