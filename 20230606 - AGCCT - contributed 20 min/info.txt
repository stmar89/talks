Title:
Cohen-Macaulay type of endomorphism rings of abelian varieties over finite fields

Abstract:
Abstract. In this talk, we will speak about the (Cohen-Macaulay) type of the endomorphism ring
of abelian varieties over a finite field with commutative endomorphism algebra. We will exhibit a
condition on the type of End(A) implying that A cannot be isomorphic to its dual. In particular,
such an A cannot be principally polarised or a Jacobian.
N.B. This is partly joint work with Caleb Springer.
